                &nbsp;&nbsp;A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent 
                movement despite the motions caused by the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the 
                wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;straps, or any other 
                kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.
                Watches were developed in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;17th century from spring-powered clocks,which appeared as early the 14th century. 
                During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by &nbsp;&nbsp;clockwork,powered by winding mainspring,
                and keeping time with oscillating balance wheel.These are called mechanical watches.In the 1960s electronic
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;quartz watch was invented,which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal.By the 1980s 
                the quartz watch had taken over most <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;of the market from the mechanical watch.Historically,this is called the quartz 
                revolution  (also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland). Developments in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2010s include smart watches, which are 
                elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist.They generally incorporate timekeeping 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;functions,but these are only a small subset of the smart watch's facilities.Old Casio watch with touchscreenIn 
                general, modern watches often display the day, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;date, month, and year. For mechanical watches, various extra features
                called "complications", such as moon-phase displays and the different types of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;tourbillon, are sometimes included.
                Most electronic quartz watches,on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers,chronographs and alarm 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;functions.Furthermore,some modern watches (like smart watches) even incorporate calculators,GPS and Bluetooth technology
                or have heart-rate monitoring &nbsp;&nbsp;capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.
                Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;movements. However, expensive collectible watches, valued
                more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple &nbsp;&nbsp;timekeeping,often have 
                traditional mechanical movements,despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts.
                As of 2018, the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Super complication,the
                world's most complicated mechanical watch until <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1989, fetching US$24 million(CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 
                11 November 2014.As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(and wristwatch) was the Patek 
                Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019.
